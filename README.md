```
void canBegin(void* data, uint16_t data_rate)
```
This function is used to initialize the MCP2515 chip.

**Parameters**

If some complicated data is to be passed for SPI port initialization (depending upon platform) then user may create a custom structure and put its definition in the file `mcp2515_driver_pal_defs.h` .

1. `CAN_FRAME_TYPE type` : The type of CAN frame.
2. `uint8_t isRemote`:

    `1` if the frame is a remote frame

    `2` if the frame is a data frame
3. `uin32_t ID` : ID of the frame. In case of standard ID, only 11 lsb are occupied. In case of extended ID only 29 lsb are occupied.
4. `uint8_t DLC` : The number of data bytes.
5. `unsigned char DATA[8]` : This array holds the actual data bytes.

<br/>
<br/>

## Macros
---

<br/>
<br/>

`AUTO_SPI_INITIALIZATION`
 
 Defined in `mcp2515_driver.h` header file.

 This macro makes the `canBegin()` API perform SPI port initialization for MCP2515 chip by call the `pal_spi_init()` API. Comment its defnition if there are multiple SPI slaves and application needs to initialize the SPI port separately. By default it is defined and thus ports are initialized by the `canBegin()` API.

 <br/>
 <br/>

 `MCP_CHIP_FREQ`

Defined in `mcp2515_driver.h` header file.

This is the frequency of oscillator that is clocking the MCP2515 chip. By default it is set to `8000000` Hz. User may change to if required.
 
<br/>
<br/>


## Platform Abstraction Layer
---

This is the layer that makes the driver cross platform compatible. This layer contains wrapper APIs that are used to access SPI port on a microcontroller. To make the API compatible with a platform, one needs to simply alter the code within the function definitions of this layer.

The actual driver APIs internally call these API for accessing the SPI port and do not know anything abou the SPI port of the actual device.

<br/>
<br/>

### Steps to port the driver for a platform

<br/>

1. Some platforms may not contain the definitions of types like `uint8_t`, `uint16_t`, `uint32_t` etc, used in the driver code. In this case open the header file `mcp2515_driver_pal_defs.h`; find and uncomment the following lines.

```
// typedef unsigned char uint8_t;
// typedef unigend short int uint16_t;
// typedef unsigned int uint32_t;
// typedef unsigned long uin64_t;
```

2. Now open the file `mcp2515_driver_pal.c` and put the platform specific code in various funtion bodies.

<br/>

In the following function, put the code needed for initializing SPI port on the device. If the user has removed `AUTO_SPI_INITIALIZATION` macro definition in which case the driver will not perform the initilzation, leave this function empty as it will never be called. 
<br/>
The `void * data` is used to pass initilization information from application code to this low level API. This information is mostly related to the slave select gpio for the MCP2515 chip. However it actually depends upon the platform.
```
void pal_spi_init(void* data, uint8_t data_direction, uint8_t idle_level, uint8_t shift_edge)
{
    /* !...Platform Specific Code here...! */
}
```

<br/>
<br/>

In the following function, put the code nedded for selecting the MCP2515 chip for SPI communication. The slave select gpio may be stored in a global variable or the user may harcode the gpio number in this function. In the latter case driver will work only when MCP2515's enable pin is wired to the hardcoded gpio pin. A better approach is to pass the gpio number from the appplication code during the initialzation and storing this number in the global variable which can be accessed by this API.

```
void pal_select_slave(void)
{
    /* !...Platform Specific Code here...! */
}
```
<br/>
<br/>

In the following function, put the code needed for de-selecting the MCP2515 chip. The slave select gpio may be stored in a global variable or the user may harcode the gpio number in this function. In the latter case driver will work only when MCP2515's enable pin is wired to the hardcoded gpio pin. A better approach is to pass the gpio number from the appplication code during the initialzation and storing this number in the global variable which can be accessed by this API.

```
void pal_deselect_slave(void)
{
    /* !...Platform Specific Code here...! */
}
```
<br/>
<br/>

In the following function, put the code needed for sending one byte of data over SPI port.
```
void pal_spi_send(uint8_t byt)
{
    /* !...Platform Specific Code here...! */
}
```

<br/>
<br/>

In the following function, put the code needed for reading one byte of data from SPI port.
```
uint8_t pal_spi_read(void)
{
    /* !...Platform Specific Code here...! */
}
```
